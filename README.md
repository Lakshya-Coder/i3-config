# My i3-WM config
Hello folks, this is my amazing config file for the i3-WM, I took inspiration from many sources, like omarchy, typercraft config files, christitus tech dotfiles and I've used what I loved from the different sources, I've a very minimal design, I have some personalised keybinding that you may like.
